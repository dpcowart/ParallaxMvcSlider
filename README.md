Sitefinity Mvc based slider that uses the Parallax effect

Before you use these files please make sure that you've added the custom module as outlined in the blog turorial. Link to blog post to come later.

The Mvc folder within the zip should be placed in the root of your project. In the case that the Mvc folder and sub-folder already exist, then you can just copy/paste the 3 mvc files into corresponding folders. The Styles folder should be placed in a folder in the root called "Custom". Same as befor, if exists then place the sub-folders/files accordingly.

Recompile project and you should be good to go.
