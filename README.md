The Mvc folder within the zip should be placed in the root of your project. In the case that the Mvc folder and sub-folder already exist, then you can just copy/paste the 3 mvc files into corresponding folders. The Styles folder should be placed in a folder in the root called "Custom". Same as befor, if exists then place the sub-folders/files accordingly.

Recompile project and you should be good to go.
